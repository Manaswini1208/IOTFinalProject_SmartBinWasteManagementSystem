# IOTFinalProject_SmartBinWasteManagementSystem
Due to the rising amount of garbage produced and the demand for sustainable waste management techniques, Smart bin waste management systems utilizing IoT (Internet of Things) technology have attracted more and more interest in recent years. These systems monitor trash cans, gather information on waste levels, and transmit that information to a central server or cloud-based platform using a number of sensors and devices. Smart bin systems can automate waste collection, improve truck routes for waste collection, lower waste collection costs, and promote more environmentally friendly waste management techniques by utilizing IoT technology.

Ultrasonic, infrared, and accelerometer sensors, microcontrollers to manage and control system functions, a network interface to enable real-time communication between system components, and a server or cloud-based platform to store and analyze data gathered by the system are the main elements of a smart bin waste management system. Together, these elements make it possible to monitor trash levels in bins in real-time, send out automatic warnings and messages when bins are full, and analyze data to improve garbage collection and treatment procedures.

The use of IoT technology to develop smart bin waste management systems has a few advantages, such as improved garbage collection and transportation efficiency, decreased waste management costs, increased environmental sustainability, and improved public health and safety. Smart bin systems are positioned to play a significant part in encouraging sustainable waste management practices and guaranteeing a healthier environment for everyone as trash management becomes an issue that is becoming increasingly urgent in metropolitan settings.

The proposed smart waste management system uses two machine learning algorithms namely Logistic Regression and LSTM (Long Short Term Memory). With the help of these algorithms, we predicted the quantity of trash in the bin and the notification will be sent for the garbage collection.
